# FormSchema
a tool for generating web forms based on a JSON schema 

> WARNING: this is mostly a think-piece at this point, and barely a specification. 
> This would be really nice for simple form generation in my applications, 

## Goals
There have been a number of situations in my development life where I've either needed users to be able to make their own forms, or been the user that has to use some half-baked form creation tool. 

FormSchema aims to be a *better* form creation tool, that accounts for the little edge-cases most half-baked form systems don't think of.

FormSchema aims to provide a solution to form creation in your applications. This can range from things like user-generated forms where technical users actually write the FormSchema JSON, to drag-and-drop forms users create in a UI, that can be validated, and used to generate valid HTML (we'll leave styling and logic up to you).

To do this, we have a few goals we want to keep in mind: 

- üß™ **Testable:** all forms should be able to be tested for validity, and provide solid error messages that explain the actual issue.
- üöÉ **Portable:** all forms should be stored in a portable format. Store your form schema in a database, a file, or a stream. 
- ü§î **Conditional:** all forms should support some sort of conditional branching to allow for more complicated form logic.
- üé® **Styleable**: you should be able to pass in custom classes, and structures to your forms to style them as needed. 
- üç¶ **Adaptable:** by sticking to the goals above, we should be able to create a system that can be adapted to work in almost any language or framework. 

## Methodology 
Form complexity can range from a few inputs and a button, to multi-step, heavily validated, conditional messes. I want to acknowledge that up-front, and try to create something that is adaptable to a simple signup form all the way to a complicated report form. 

### Storage Medium
**FormSchema is going to use the JSON format to store all it's form information.** JSON is the defacto standard for semi-unstructured web data at this point, and it seems like a pretty obvious choice.  

### Form Attributes
At a high level, each form is going to have a few basic attributes on your 
form schemas. Things like the form name, method, and action. 

An example of the top level of a form schema could be:

```json
{
  "formName": "login",
  "formId": "login",
  "method": "POST",
  "action": "/api/auth/login",
  "children": [...]
}
```

### Form Elements 
Form elements are the main inputs, sections, fieldsets, etc that you'll find in a form. By default, all form elements have two things: an ID, and a name. 

Some form elements would include: 
- text inputs
- select inputs
- fieldsets
- text areas 
- radio buttons
- checkboxes
- submit buttons 
- file uploads

Elements like fieldsets, and selects can have children.
